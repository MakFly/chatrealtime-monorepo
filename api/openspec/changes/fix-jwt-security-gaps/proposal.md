# Fix JWT Security Gaps

## Why

The current JWT authentication implementation has critical security vulnerabilities that make it unsuitable for production:

- **No rate limiting** on authentication endpoints, making them vulnerable to brute force attacks
- **No refresh token rotation** - same refresh token reused multiple times, creating security risks
- **No access token blacklisting** - impossible to revoke tokens before expiration
- **Missing security headers** - no protection against common web vulnerabilities
- **Insufficient input validation** - basic validation that doesn't prevent injection attacks
- **No monitoring** of suspicious authentication patterns

These gaps were identified during security audit and must be addressed before production deployment.

## What Changes

### Critical Security Fixes
- **Rate limiting implementation** using Symfony Rate Limiter on all auth endpoints
- **Refresh token rotation** - invalidate old tokens and generate new ones on each refresh
- **Access token blacklisting** - ability to revoke tokens immediately on logout/security breach
- **Security headers middleware** - comprehensive security headers on all responses
- **Enhanced input validation** - robust validation with proper error handling
- **Security monitoring** - detection and alerting of suspicious authentication patterns

### Rate Limiting Protection
- **Login endpoint**: 5 attempts per minute per IP address
- **Register endpoint**: 3 attempts per minute per IP address  
- **Refresh endpoint**: 10 attempts per minute per user
- **Logout endpoint**: 20 attempts per minute per IP address
- **Progressive penalties** for repeated violations

### Token Security Enhancements
- **Refresh token rotation** on every refresh operation
- **Token blacklist** with Redis storage for immediate revocation
- **Shorter refresh token TTL** (7 days instead of 30 days)
- **Token fingerprinting** to detect token theft/reuse

### Security Headers Implementation
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY
- **X-XSS-Protection**: 1; mode=block
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
- **Cache-Control**: private, no-cache for sensitive endpoints

### Enhanced Input Validation
- **Email format validation** with proper regex patterns
- **Password strength requirements** (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- **SQL injection prevention** with parameterized queries only
- **XSS prevention** with proper JSON encoding

### Security Monitoring
- **Failed login attempt tracking** with IP and timestamp
- **Suspicious pattern detection** (multiple IPs, rapid attempts)
- **Security event logging** with structured data for analysis
- **Alert system** for security team notification

## Impact

### Affected Specifications
- **MODIFIED**: `specs/jwt-authentication/` - Enhanced token security and rotation
- **MODIFIED**: `specs/api-security/` - Rate limiting and security headers
- **NEW**: `specs/security-monitoring/` - Monitoring and alerting capabilities

### Breaking Changes
- **Refresh token behavior**: Old refresh tokens become invalid after first use
- **Rate limiting**: Clients may receive 429 responses if they exceed limits
- **Security headers**: May affect frontend caching behavior

### Dependencies
- **Redis** for token blacklist storage
- **Symfony Rate Limiter** bundle for rate limiting
- **Monitoring system** for security alerts (optional)

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Critical - Week 1)
1. Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
2. Refresh token rotation implementation
3. Security headers middleware
4. Enhanced input validation

### Phase 2 (Important - Week 2)  
1. Access token blacklisting with Redis
2. Security monitoring and logging
3. Progressive rate limiting penalties
4. Token fingerprinting

### Phase 3 (Enhancement - Week 3)
1. Advanced threat detection
2. Security dashboard
3. Automated security testing
4. Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

- **Zero successful brute force attacks** on authentication endpoints
- **Immediate token revocation** capability for security incidents
- **Comprehensive security headers** on all API responses
- **Robust input validation** preventing injection attacks
- **Security monitoring** detecting and alerting on threats
- **Performance impact** < 50ms additional latency per request
