# Token Security Specification

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Refresh Token Rotation
The system SHALL rotate refresh tokens on every use to prevent token reuse attacks.

#### Scenario: Successful token refresh with rotation
- **WHEN** a user sends a valid refresh token to `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
- **THEN** the system validates the refresh token exists and is not expired
- **AND** generates a new access token for the user
- **AND** invalidates the old refresh token immediately
- **AND** generates a new refresh token with 7-day expiration
- **AND** stores the new refresh token in the database
- **AND** returns both the new access token and new refresh token

#### Scenario: Old refresh token becomes invalid
- **WHEN** a user attempts to use the old refresh token after rotation
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized
- **AND** includes error message "Refresh token has been invalidated"
- **AND** logs the attempt for security monitoring

#### Scenario: Multiple refresh attempts with same token
- **WHEN** a user attempts to refresh the same token multiple times
- **THEN** only the first attempt succeeds and rotates the token
- **AND** subsequent attempts with the old token fail
- **AND** the system logs multiple attempts as suspicious activity

### Requirement: Access Token Blacklisting
The system SHALL implement access token blacklisting for immediate revocation.

#### Scenario: Token blacklisting on logout
- **WHEN** a user logs out via `/api/v1/auth/logout`
- **THEN** the system adds the access token to the blacklist
- **AND** stores the blacklisted token in Redis with TTL matching token expiration
- **AND** returns HTTP 204 No Content
- **AND** logs the token revocation for audit

#### Scenario: Blacklisted token rejection
- **WHEN** a request includes a blacklisted access token
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized
- **AND** includes error message "Token has been revoked"
- **AND** logs the attempt for security monitoring

#### Scenario: Admin token revocation
- **WHEN** an administrator revokes all tokens for a user
- **THEN** the system blacklists all active access tokens for that user
- **AND** removes all refresh tokens from the database
- **AND** logs the administrative action for audit

### Requirement: Token Fingerprinting
The system SHALL implement token fingerprinting to detect token theft.

#### Scenario: Token fingerprinting on generation
- **WHEN** a new access token is generated
- **THEN** the system includes a fingerprint in the token payload
- **AND** the fingerprint is based on:
  - User agent hash
  - IP address hash
  - Device characteristics
  - Browser fingerprint (if available)

#### Scenario: Fingerprint validation on use
- **WHEN** a request includes an access token
- **THEN** the system validates the token fingerprint matches current request
- **AND** allows the request if fingerprints match
- **AND** logs suspicious activity if fingerprints don't match

#### Scenario: Token theft detection
- **WHEN** a token is used with a different fingerprint
- **THEN** the system logs the event as potential token theft
- **AND** optionally revokes the token for security
- **AND** alerts the security team if configured

### Requirement: Shorter Token Lifetimes
The system SHALL use shorter token lifetimes to reduce exposure window.

#### Scenario: Access token lifetime
- **WHEN** an access token is generated
- **THEN** the token expires in 1 hour (3600 seconds)
- **AND** the expiration is set in the `exp` claim
- **AND** the token cannot be used after expiration

#### Scenario: Refresh token lifetime
- **WHEN** a refresh token is generated
- **THEN** the token expires in 7 days (604800 seconds)
- **AND** the expiration is stored in the database
- **AND** the token cannot be used after expiration

#### Scenario: Token expiration handling
- **WHEN** a request includes an expired token
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 401 Unauthorized
- **AND** includes error message "Token has expired"
- **AND** logs the expired token attempt

### Requirement: Token Cleanup
The system SHALL automatically clean up expired and invalid tokens.

#### Scenario: Expired token cleanup
- **WHEN** the cleanup command runs (daily at 2 AM)
- **THEN** the system removes all expired refresh tokens from the database
- **AND** removes expired blacklisted tokens from Redis
- **AND** logs the cleanup statistics

#### Scenario: Orphaned token cleanup
- **WHEN** a user is deleted
- **THEN** the system removes all associated refresh tokens
- **AND** blacklists all active access tokens for that user
- **AND** logs the cleanup for audit

#### Scenario: Cleanup performance
- **WHEN** the cleanup process runs
- **THEN** it completes within 5 minutes
- **AND** does not impact API performance
- **AND** handles large numbers of tokens efficiently

### Requirement: Token Security Monitoring
The system SHALL monitor token usage for security threats.

#### Scenario: Token usage logging
- **WHEN** tokens are generated, refreshed, or revoked
- **THEN** the system logs the event with:
  - User identifier
  - Token type (access/refresh)
  - IP address and user agent
  - Timestamp and action
  - Security context

#### Scenario: Suspicious token activity
- **WHEN** the system detects suspicious token activity
- **THEN** it logs patterns such as:
  - Multiple refresh attempts in short time
  - Token usage from different geographic locations
  - Unusual token usage patterns
  - Potential token theft indicators

#### Scenario: Token security metrics
- **WHEN** the system collects token security metrics
- **THEN** it tracks:
  - Token generation rate
  - Token refresh rate
  - Token revocation rate
  - Failed token validation rate
  - Suspicious activity rate

### Requirement: Token Storage Security
The system SHALL secure token storage and transmission.

#### Scenario: Database token storage
- **WHEN** refresh tokens are stored in the database
- **THEN** they are stored with proper encryption
- **AND** database connections use TLS
- **AND** access is restricted to application servers only

#### Scenario: Redis token storage
- **WHEN** blacklisted tokens are stored in Redis
- **THEN** Redis connections use TLS
- **AND** Redis is configured with authentication
- **AND** sensitive data is encrypted at rest

#### Scenario: Token transmission
- **WHEN** tokens are transmitted between client and server
- **THEN** all communication uses HTTPS
- **AND** tokens are never transmitted in URL parameters
- **AND** tokens are never logged in access logs

### Requirement: Token Validation Security
The system SHALL validate tokens securely to prevent attacks.

#### Scenario: Token signature validation
- **WHEN** a request includes an access token
- **THEN** the system validates the token signature using the public key
- **AND** rejects tokens with invalid signatures
- **AND** logs signature validation failures

#### Scenario: Token expiration validation
- **WHEN** a request includes an access token
- **THEN** the system validates the token has not expired
- **AND** rejects expired tokens immediately
- **AND** logs expired token attempts

#### Scenario: Token blacklist validation
- **WHEN** a request includes an access token
- **THEN** the system checks if the token is blacklisted
- **AND** rejects blacklisted tokens immediately
- **AND** logs blacklisted token attempts

#### Scenario: Token fingerprint validation
- **WHEN** a request includes an access token
- **THEN** the system validates the token fingerprint
- **AND** allows requests with matching fingerprints
- **AND** logs requests with mismatched fingerprints as suspicious
