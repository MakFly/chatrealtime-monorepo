# Rate Limiting Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Authentication Endpoint Rate Limiting
The system SHALL implement rate limiting on all authentication endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.

#### Scenario: Login endpoint rate limiting
- **WHEN** a client makes more than 5 login attempts within 1 minute from the same IP address
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
- **AND** includes `Retry-After` header with seconds until limit resets
- **AND** includes `X-RateLimit-Limit` header with the limit value (5)
- **AND** includes `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header with remaining requests
- **AND** includes `X-RateLimit-Reset` header with Unix timestamp of limit reset
- **AND** logs the rate-limited attempt for security monitoring

#### Scenario: Register endpoint rate limiting
- **WHEN** a client makes more than 3 registration attempts within 1 minute from the same IP address
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
- **AND** includes rate limit headers as specified above
- **AND** logs the rate-limited attempt for security monitoring

#### Scenario: Refresh endpoint rate limiting
- **WHEN** a client makes more than 10 refresh token requests within 1 minute for the same user
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
- **AND** includes rate limit headers as specified above
- **AND** logs the rate-limited attempt for security monitoring

#### Scenario: Logout endpoint rate limiting
- **WHEN** a client makes more than 20 logout attempts within 1 minute from the same IP address
- **THEN** the system returns HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
- **AND** includes rate limit headers as specified above
- **AND** logs the rate-limited attempt for security monitoring

### Requirement: Progressive Rate Limiting
The system SHALL implement progressive penalties for repeated rate limit violations.

#### Scenario: First violation
- **WHEN** a client exceeds the rate limit for the first time
- **THEN** the system applies the standard rate limit (5 attempts/minute for login)
- **AND** logs the violation with severity "warning"
- **AND** includes standard rate limit headers

#### Scenario: Repeated violations
- **WHEN** a client exceeds the rate limit multiple times within 1 hour
- **THEN** the system applies progressive penalties:
  - 2nd violation: 3 attempts/minute for 1 hour
  - 3rd violation: 1 attempt/minute for 4 hours
  - 4th+ violation: 1 attempt/hour for 24 hours
- **AND** logs the violation with severity "error"
- **AND** includes escalated rate limit headers

#### Scenario: Violation reset
- **WHEN** a client has no violations for 24 hours
- **THEN** the system resets the violation count to zero
- **AND** restores standard rate limits
- **AND** logs the reset for audit purposes

### Requirement: Rate Limiting Configuration
The system SHALL allow configuration of rate limits via environment variables.

#### Scenario: Environment-based rate limiting
- **WHEN** the system is configured with different environments
- **THEN** development allows higher limits (10 attempts/minute for login)
- **AND** staging uses production-like limits (5 attempts/minute for login)
- **AND** production uses strict limits (5 attempts/minute for login)
- **AND** limits are configured via `RATE_LIMIT_*` environment variables

#### Scenario: Dynamic rate limiting
- **WHEN** the system detects suspicious patterns
- **THEN** it can dynamically adjust rate limits
- **AND** temporarily reduce limits for high-risk IPs
- **AND** increase limits for trusted sources
- **AND** log all dynamic adjustments for audit

### Requirement: Rate Limiting Bypass
The system SHALL allow bypassing rate limits for trusted sources.

#### Scenario: Trusted IP bypass
- **WHEN** requests come from whitelisted IP addresses
- **THEN** the system does not apply rate limiting
- **AND** logs the bypass for audit purposes
- **AND** monitors for abuse even from trusted sources

#### Scenario: API key bypass
- **WHEN** requests include valid API keys
- **THEN** the system applies higher rate limits (100 attempts/minute)
- **AND** logs the API key usage for audit
- **AND** validates API key permissions

### Requirement: Rate Limiting Monitoring
The system SHALL monitor and log rate limiting events for security analysis.

#### Scenario: Rate limit violation logging
- **WHEN** a client exceeds the rate limit
- **THEN** the system logs the event with:
  - IP address and user agent
  - Endpoint and method
  - Timestamp and violation count
  - Rate limit headers sent
  - User identifier (if authenticated)

#### Scenario: Suspicious pattern detection
- **WHEN** the system detects suspicious patterns
- **THEN** it logs patterns such as:
  - Multiple IPs for same user
  - Rapid sequential attempts
  - Unusual geographic patterns
  - Bot-like behavior signatures

#### Scenario: Rate limiting metrics
- **WHEN** the system collects rate limiting metrics
- **THEN** it tracks:
  - Total requests per endpoint
  - Rate limit violations per IP
  - Average response times
  - Cache hit rates for rate limiters

### Requirement: Rate Limiting Performance
The system SHALL ensure rate limiting does not impact API performance.

#### Scenario: Rate limiting overhead
- **WHEN** rate limiting is enabled
- **THEN** the additional latency per request is less than 10ms
- **AND** the memory usage increase is less than 50MB
- **AND** the CPU usage increase is less than 5%

#### Scenario: High concurrency handling
- **WHEN** the system receives high concurrent requests
- **THEN** rate limiting remains accurate and consistent
- **AND** no race conditions occur in rate limit calculations
- **AND** Redis operations are optimized for performance

#### Scenario: Rate limiting scalability
- **WHEN** the system scales horizontally
- **THEN** rate limiting works consistently across all instances
- **AND** shared state is maintained in Redis
- **AND** rate limits are enforced globally, not per instance
