  - VPN/proxy detection

### Requirement: Security Alert System
The system SHALL alert security team on critical security events.

#### Scenario: High-risk authentication alert

#### Scenario: Brute force attack alert
- **WHEN** a brute force attack is detected
- **THEN** the system sends an immediate alert
- **AND** includes attack details and affected systems
- **AND** provides mitigation recommendations
- **AND** logs the alert and response

#### Scenario: Token theft alert
- **WHEN** potential token theft is detected
- **THEN** the system sends an urgent alert
- **AND** includes token details and usage patterns
- **AND** recommends token revocation
- **AND** logs the alert and actions taken

### Requirement: Security Metrics Collection
The system SHALL collect security metrics for analysis and reporting.

#### Scenario: Authentication metrics
- **WHEN** the system collects authentication metrics
- **THEN** it tracks:
  - Total authentication attempts per hour/day
  - Success/failure rates by method
  - Geographic distribution of attempts
  - User agent patterns and changes

#### Scenario: Rate limiting metrics
- **WHEN** the system collects rate limiting metrics
- **THEN** it tracks:
  - Rate limit violations per endpoint
  - IP addresses with most violations
  - Effectiveness of rate limiting
  - False positive rates

#### Scenario: Token security metrics
- **WHEN** the system collects token security metrics
- **THEN** it tracks:
  - Token generation and refresh rates
  - Token revocation rates
  - Failed token validations
  - Suspicious token usage patterns

### Requirement: Security Dashboard
The system SHALL provide a security dashboard for monitoring and analysis.

#### Scenario: Real-time security dashboard
- **WHEN** security team accesses the dashboard
- **THEN** it displays:
  - Current security events and alerts
  - Authentication attempt patterns
  - Rate limiting status and violations
  - Token usage statistics

#### Scenario: Historical security analysis
- **WHEN** security team analyzes historical data
- **THEN** the dashboard provides:
  - Security event timeline
  - Pattern analysis and trends
  - Risk score evolution
  - Incident correlation

#### Scenario: Security reporting
- **WHEN** security reports are generated
- **THEN** they include:
  - Summary of security events
  - Risk assessments and trends
  - Recommendations for improvements
  - Compliance status

### Requirement: Security Event Correlation
The system SHALL correlate security events to identify complex attack patterns.

#### Scenario: Multi-event correlation
- **WHEN** multiple security events occur
- **THEN** the system correlates events to identify patterns
